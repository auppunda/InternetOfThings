Makefile: includes a default, check, clean, and dist target. Default builds program, check tests with 
a smoke test, clean deletes all program and output generated by the makefile, and dist creates
the deliverable tarball.

test.sh: tests normal temperature readings and formatting, tests shutdown formatting, 
tests sending bogus commands, and normal commands.

lab4b.c: Initializes a button and temperature sensor on the beaglebone, and allows 
user to send in commands to specify the sampling time of the temperature, the 
type of temperature, stopping the sampling, and starting the sampling. The user
can also send off to stop the program and have it exit normally. The lab
uses polling to read from standard in so that it doesn't block the program, 
as it isn't multi-threaded.
